\begin{abstract}
This thesis discusses a search for the Standard Model single top \Wtchan\ process. An analysis has been performed searching for the \Wtchan\ process using 4.7 $fb^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. A boosted decision tree is trained using machine learning techniques to increase the separation between signal and background. A profile likelihood fit is used to measure the cross-section of the \Wtchan\ process at $\sigma(pp\rightarrow Wt + X) = 16.8 ^{+2.9}_{-2.9} \mathrm{(stat)} ^{+4.9}_{-4.9} \mathrm{(syst)}~pb$, consistent with the Standard Model prediction. This fit is also used to generate pseudoexperiments to calculate the significance, finding an observed (expected) 3.3$\sigma$ (3.4$\sigma$) excess over background.

\begin{acknowledgment}
I am immensely thankful for the amazing people who have helped and encouraged me as I worked on this dissertation. I'd like to express deep gratitude to my advisor, Jim Linnemann, for all of his mentorship. I'd also like to give special thanks to Huaqiao Zhang for his patience in working with me on this analysis and teaching me so much about HEP. I would also like to thank Reinhard Schwienhorst for working with me from day one of my time at MSU.

It is almost impossible to name all of my fellow students and coworkers who have helped me both as physicists and friends. Thank you to James Kraus, for showing me the ropes while we muddled through L1Calo upgrade planning. A massive debt is also owed to the students who have graduated before me for all the times they helped me, and for raising the bar so very high, especially Sarah Heim, Jenny Holzbauer, and Jeremiah Holzbauer.  I'd also like to thank Emily Johnson, Brad Schoenrock, and Patrick True, who volunteered their time to review my dissertation, to act as a sounding board for my ideas, and, most importantly, to listen to me complain. 

I'd like to acknowledge the people who made this dissertation possible in a myriad of indirect ways. Thank you to Dennis Hewett, for giving me the passion for physics that led me here. Thank you to my favorite cat Elly for putting up with the upsetting lack of belly rubs over the last year. Most importantly, I cannot thank my parents enough for instilling in me a love for science and supporting me in everything I do.
