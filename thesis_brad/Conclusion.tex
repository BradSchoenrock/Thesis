An upper limit on the \xs~for \tz~is measured using 3.2~\fb~of data collected by the ATLAS detector at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV. Events are selected using a series of selection cuts which select for three leptons, between 2 and 4 jets, \met~, and 1 \btag. A profile likelihood is performed in order to make a measurement of the \tz~\xs. The extracted \xs~measurement is $\sigma_{tZ}$~=~448~$\pm$~672~(stat)~$\pm$~448~(syst)~fb. The resulting upper limit is consistent with the standard model prediction  with an exclusion of $\sigma_{tZ}$ = 1345 fb at the 95\% confidence level.
