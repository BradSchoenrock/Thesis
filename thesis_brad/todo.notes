Overall formatting things. 

- Section 6.1, the bullets have text and not just references to figures.
- Figures should appear in the order in which they are referenced.
- You need to explain all variables and parameters in all equations.
- Check hyphenation: It should be top-quark mass, but the top quark.
- Similarly, if you write W-boson, then do that every where. same comment for Z-boson, b-jet, etc.  I have found a few “Z boson”.
- Make sure everything is in present tense.



line 17: should be search, not measurement. I don’t think you’ll be able to measure the cross-section.
line 17: should be “search for the production of a single top quark in association with a Z boson”.
line 18: remove “used”.
line 20: production -> production mode.
line 20: selections are ... -> selection requirements are made to isolate the final state containing three leptons, a b-quark jet and a light quark jet.
line 21: this sentence appears to repeat what you said in the previous sentence.
line 22: this sentence should be re-phrased to give the upper limit at the 95% confidence level on the production cross-section.

Event Simulation

line 695: “Monte Carlo” should be capitalized every time.
line 695: typo: excel
line 699: make sure the whole document is in present tense.
line 699: you don’t really decide, you just follow the top-group prescriptions and you use common top group samples.
Section 4.1. From the title I was expecting this section to describe how you go from the physics and Feynman diagram and section 1.4 to events generated for ATLAS. You already mention Madgraph in section 1.4, so there is no need to motivate its use here. I think you should use this section to explain what Madgraph is, and then contrast that with Powheg, and then also explain Pythia/Herwig and Geant.
Section 4.2 should not mention mCFM or Powheg since those aren’t used. Instead of trying to motivate, you should use this section to explain the settings.
line 718: be consistent and always use POWHEG-BOX.
line 719 an a few others: no math mode as the first word in a sentence. This also applies to titles. So the title here should be “top quark pair production” or something like that.
Section 4.5: I would prefer to use the term ttV, and then say that V can stand for W or Z. Does this also include ttH?
line 733: don’t use words like “sporting”, that’s too colloquial.
line 739: what is the point of this sentence? Isn’t it a self-evident statement?
line 740/741: no sentence should start with a math symbol. Also, should remove “to the even yield”.
line 746: typo: immense. Also, better to use “large” since it’s not clear what immense means. Also, remember, here and elsewhere, to keep everything in present tense.
line 751/752: which generation is the default? if the other one isn’t used for anything, don’ mention it.
line 755: It’s not the physics that’s messy but the energy deposits and hits in the detector, which then have to be reconstructed.
line 760: what are light and heavy jets?
line 760: this is really more nuanced than you write here. Focus on what gets reconstructed from detector hits, then what’s reconstructed from those objects.
line 767: abs -> ||




---------------------------------------------

Object Reconstruction

Sections 5.1 and 5.2: make these sections symmetric in the information content. Give the definition for the electrons and muons that you actually use in the analysis. You also need to describe isolation in these two sections. Finally, for the electron and muon definitions that we actually use, give representative efficiency numbers.



---------------------------------------------

Analysis

- l780: I think you need to give the preselection cuts, then also give the control region cuts, then explain the background estimation method, then you can show the plots and can show tables.


- Table 6.1 should use proper rounding and ideally should also have uncertainties.
