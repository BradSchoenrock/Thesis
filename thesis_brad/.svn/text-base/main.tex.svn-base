\begin{abstract}

This document reports the measurement of the top-quark $Z$-boson associated production cross-section using data from the ATLAS detector. The data used were collected during 2015, from proton-proton collisions with a 13 TeV center-of-mass collision energy. To isolate this production, selections are applied to find events with a specific final state. A cut-based analysis is used to isolate \tz~using a series of selections in several kinematic regions. A statistical analysis is performed to determine the measured cross-section and check that measured value with the standard model prediction. The resulting cross-section measurement is $\sigma_{tZ}$ = XYZ $\pm$ abc.

%I would like to thank the following people. 

%My family, specifically my parents. Without their guidance I would not be the person I am today. I often think they should have written a parenting book because of the remarkable example they have set for me. 

%The members of the Wisconsin Trailblazers. Growing up around all of you showed me what hard work and kindness could accomplish. 

%My wife Rachel, who has inspired me every day to accomplish all that I have. 

%My high school teachers who took an interest in the education of every student they taught. They inspired me to be creative and investigative when I solved problems which were skills that served me well in graduate school and life. 

%My undergraduate and graduate professors, specifically Dr. Tireman and Dr. Donovan who encouraged me to get involved with research as an undergraduate. 

%My committee members who oversaw this research: Drs. Reinhard Schwienhorst, Kirsten Tollefson, Carl Schmidt, Norman Birge, and Gerd Kortemeyer. 

%My advisor Reinhard Schwienhorst for his continued mentorship. 

%All of the post docs and other students who I have had the pleasure of working with at MSU. Some of you helped me debug code while others gave me something to smile at every day. 

%The entire ATLAS community without which there would be no experiment nor chance at answering the great questions.
