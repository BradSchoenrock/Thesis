\begin{abstract}
%% Type your abstract here. An abstract is REQUIRED and limited to two pages.
%% The abstract must not include any figures.


This document reports on the search for the production of a \at~in association with a \az~using data from the ATLAS detector. The data was collected during 2015, from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13~TeV delivered by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. To isolate this production mode, selection requirements are made on the three leptons, b-quark jet and light quark jet that \tz~naturally contains. A profile likelihood fit is performed to put an upper limit on the Standard Model predicted \xs. The resulting measurement is consistent with the Standard Model prediction.

I would like to thank the following people. 

My family, specifically my parents. Without their guidance I would not be the person I am today. I often think they should have written a parenting book because of the remarkable example they have set for me. 

The members of the Wisconsin Trailblazers. Growing up around all of you showed me what hard work and kindness could accomplish. 

My wife Rachel, who has inspired me every day to accomplish all that I have. 

My high school teachers who took an interest in the education of every student they taught. They inspired me to be creative and investigative when I solved problems which were skills that served me well in graduate school and life. 

My undergraduate and graduate professors, specifically Dr. Tireman and Dr. Donovan who encouraged me to get involved with research as an undergraduate. 

My committee members who oversaw this research: Drs. Reinhard Schwienhorst, Kirsten Tollefson, Carl Schmidt, Norman Birge, and Gerd Kortemeyer. 

My adviser Reinhard Schwienhorst for his continued mentorship. 

All of the post docs and other students who I have had the pleasure of working with at MSU. Some of you helped me debug code while others gave me something to smile at every day. 

The entire ATLAS community without which there would be no experiment nor chance at answering the great questions. 

\end{acknowledgment}

%%%%%% LANDSCAPE PAGES  %%%%%%
%% To produce graphics or tables in landscape mode,
%% begin by removing the "%" in the next two lines.
%\begin{landscape}
%\thispagestyle{empty}
%% The contents of the page can be centered using the center environment
%% or the \centering command. Insert either a table with the tabular environment
%% or input a graphics file.
%% Use \captionof{table}{caption_text} (or figure in place of table) 
%% to create the caption for a short table or a figure. 
%% Insert a long table in a table environment. It disables double spacing
%% which is permitted for long tables. Finally remove the "%" from the next line.

%%%%%%%    APPENDICES    %%%%%%%%%%
%% If you wish to include just one appendix, remove the "%" 
%% in front of \appendix below. To include two or more appendices,
%% remove the "%" in front of \appendices.
%\appendix
%\appendices

%% In either cast to start your first appendix, which will be labeled
%% as Appendix A, just type \chapter{<appendix 1 name>}
%% and enter the text of the appendix as you would a chapter,
%% with one exception. If you use any subdivisions, such as 
%% section, subsection etc., use the starred version; that is,
%% \section*{section name}.  Such subdivisions are not to be 
%% listed in the Table of Contents.

%%%%%%% A NOTE ABOUT APPENDICES %%%%%%%%%
%% Some appendices may be single-spaced such as survey examples
%% or letters. See the Graduate School's formatting guide for details.
%% To single space an appendix first remove the "%" from 
%% the following two lines.
%\end{doublespace}
%\chapter{<appendix name>}
%% Insert the name of the appendix.
%% Insert the text of the appendix.
%% Remove the "%" from the following line.
%\begin{doublespace}
%% Any text entered now will be double spaced.

%%%%%%  Bibliography %%%%%
%% A bibliography is required. By default it is called, "Bibliography"
%% You may use ÒLITERATURE CITEDÓ, ÒWORKS CITEDÓ or ÒREFERENCESÓ 
%% instead of ÒBIBLIOGRAPHYÓ if that is the convention in your discipline. 
%% To do so, copy and paste your choice into the empty argument 
%% of the following command and remove the "%".
%\renewcommand{\bibname}{}


\bibliographystyle{atlasnote}
%\bibliographystyle{unsrt}
\bibliography{bibmain}


%% The bibliography may be made using BibTeX.
%% To do so the necessary commands must be entered in the 
%% preamble and here.
%% If the Bibliography is made from scratch,
%% remove the "%" in front of \begin{thebibliography}{???}
%% replacing the ??? with the appropriate entry and 
%% remove the "%" in front of \end{thebibliography} below.
% \begin{thebibliography}{???}
%%  Enter the bibliography here.
% \end{thebibliography}
%% In either case, the bibliography is automatically entered
%% in the Table of Contents.
\end{document}

%%%%%% FINAL COMMENTS %%%%
%% Before submitting your dissertation to the Graduate School
%% Make sure there isn't any text in the right margins. To do 
%% in the .log file look for error messages beginning with, 
%% "Overfull \hbox ". 

%% Once your document has been filed with the Graduate School,
%% if you wish to produce a single spaced version of your document, 
%% find and remove the commands \begin{doublespace}
%% and \end{doublespace} above.
