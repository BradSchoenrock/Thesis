\chapter{Alternative Analysis Channels}
\label{alternativechannels}
The main analysis in this document made use of the 2 and 3 jet channels, split into positive or negative lepton charge (see Section~\ref{sec:channels}).  However, there are other possibilities.  For instance, the four jet bin, although the ``natural'' bin for \ttbar~production, could still be a useful channel if the \ttbar~can be successfully removed.  Similarly the 3 jet bin, where 2 jets are b-tagged (unlike 1 b-tagged jet in the main analysis) is also dominated by \ttbar~production.  If \ttbar~can be removed from this bin, we may be able to see our single-top signal.  The event yields for these two bins (split into lepton charge) after all preselection cuts including either 1 or 2 b-tagged jets, are shown in Table~\ref{tab:tag_eventyields_extra}.  The signal divided by background (S/B) value is also shown.  No W+jets normalization scale factors or multijet estimates are included in any of the tables in this discussion.  However, as the yields are dominated by top processes, neither exclusion is expected to have a large effect on the conclusions of this study.

The first two selections in the main analysis (Section~\ref{sec:selectionchoices}) make use of differences between the t-channel single-top production and its backgrounds, and we apply both of these selections here with a slight variation on the reconstructed top mass selection.  The reasoning is the same as before.  The t-channel single-top production often has an energetic forward non-b jet, whereas \ttbar~tends to have more central jets.  Also, the signal only has one top quark whereas \ttbar~has two.  Due to reconstruction difficulties, the b associated with the top decaying to leptons is not always correctly assigned when determining the reconstructed top mass for \ttbar~prodcution, so a selection requiring a top mass near the expected value is useful.  Similarly, requiring the highest \pt~untagged jet to be forward is also helpful, just as in the main analysis.  The yields after requiring $|\eta({\rm j_{u}})|>2.0$ and then after also requiring $M_{top}(\rm l\nu b)<190\GeV$ are shown in Tables~\ref{tab:tag_eventyields_extra_ueta} and~\ref{tab:tag_eventyields_extra_uetatm} respectively.  We use only the upper top mass selection from the main analysis here because of the low multijet expectation (which is ignored for this discussion) in these bins.

Finally, we can also make use of the invariant mass of the jets.  In the main analysis (Section~\ref{sec:selectionchoices}), the 3 jet bin had a large \ttbar~component, and we used a selection involving the invariant mass of the jets to remove \ttbar~events.  For the 4 jet bin, we propose requiring the invariant mass of all jets except the best jet to be greater than 450 GeV.  The best jet is the jet which, plus the lepton and \met, best produces the expected standard model top mass.  Thus, we are looking at the invariant mass of what should be the other top quark in the case of \ttbar~production, and the invariant mass should be close to that value.  Single-top t-channel can have a very energetic jet separated from the top quark decay products, leading to a potentially very high invariant mass.  These two effects give some separation, and we remove events where the invariant mass is lower.  Similarly for the 3 jet, 2-btagged jet selection, we can look at this same invariant mass of all jets minus the best jet greater than 250 GeV.  This should give us the invariant mass of most of the jets from the other top quark in the case of \ttbar~production and so we again remove events where this invariant mass is lower to reduce \ttbar~contanimation.  Specifically we require $M(\mathrm{All Jets Minus Best Jet}) > 450\GeV$ for the four jet channel and $M(\mathrm{All Jets Minus Best Jet}) > 250\GeV$ for the three jet channel.

The yields after these two invariant mass selections are given in Table~\ref{tab:tag_eventyields_extra_uetatminvmass}.  This table shows that the \ttbar~events are removed at a larger rate than the signal, improving the S/B value from the previous tables.  Most S/B values are over 0.5 and one is over 1.5.  Of course, the yields themselves are low, leading to larger statistical uncertainties.  However, these tables are normalized to the integrated luminosity used in the main analysis, 1.04 fb$^{-1}$.  Future analysis will use data sets of 5, 10, or more times this value, making these sorts of tight selections more useful for those analyses.
