\begin{abstract}
This thesis presents the search for W'$\rightarrow$tb using the LHC pp collision data collected with the ATLAS detector at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. The primary backgrounds to this search are ttbar, W+jets, and multijets processes. To reduce the contributions of these backgrounds we require a leptonic final state and use Boosted Decision Trees to discriminate between signal and background-like events. This measurement gives limits on the W'$\rightarrow$tb cross-section times branching ratio and on the ratio of coupling constants g'/g as functions of the W' mass.


%formatted for stupid proquest
%This thesis discusses a search for the Standard Model single top Wt-channel process. An analysis has been performed searching for the Wt-channel process using 4.7 fb<super>-1<\super> of integrated luminosity collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. A boosted decision tree is trained using machine learning techniques to increase the separation between signal and background. A profile likelihood fit is used to measure the cross-section of the Wt-channel process at 16.8 &plusmn;2.9 (stat) &plusmn; 4.9(syst) pb, consistent with the Standard Model prediction. This fit is also used to generate pseudoexperiments to calculate the significance, finding an observed (expected) 3.3 &sigma; (3.4 &sigma;) excess over background.
